## Classes and Namespaces -- API Documentation

The API documentation (documentation built from the docblocks of all classes and functions) can be built from the parent directory by running this script:

    ./makedoc.sh

This will make a documents/main directory in your source tree. Point your web browser at that.  That is where the documentation for all of the classes and namespaces is to be found.
