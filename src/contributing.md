## Introduction

Administrator's source is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddpro/admin). It's distributed under the MIT license, so you are free to fork it and do whatever you like with it. In fact it started as another project also under the MIT license, [FrozenNode's Laravel-Administrator](https://github.com/FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator/)

## Bugs, Questions, and Feature Requests

If you've found a bug with Administrator, if you have a question, or if you have a feature request, the best way to get our attention is to post an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ddpro/admin/issues).

## Pull Requests

We love it when people submit pull requests. They don't always get merged into the core, but they almost always make us think about what is possible with Administrator and whether or not our current approach is adequate. If you'd like to submit a pull request, there are a few things that you should do in order to ensure a timely response:

- Fork from the `master` branch.

- Merge the latest changes from the `master` branch before you submit the pull request. If you have a request that can't be automatically merged, you may be asked to marge the latest changes and resubmit it.

- Add documentation for your changes to the relevant section in the `/docs` directory.

- Add any necessary unit tests

- Follow the [style guide](/src/style-guide.md)!
